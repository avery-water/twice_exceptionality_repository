Avery notes from following "Walkthrough" document linked above: 
[1] In terminal on Rachelâ€™s computer, change directory to project folder 
    >> cd /Documents/2EProject
[2] Create folder for DICOMS (all in one folder) according to BIDS format 
    >> mkdir sourcedata 
[3] Copy DICOMS into sourcedata folder
    >> cp -avr 01-SubjectScans/* sourcedata/. 
    >> not enough space to do this, leaving as is for now
    >> cp -avr 02-ControlFiles/* sourcedata/.
    >> not enough space to do this, leaving as is for now, removed sourcedata directory 
    >> rm -fr sourcedata
[4] Create folder for conversion according to BIDS format 
    >> mkdir rawdata 
[5] Create folder for bids conversion notes/ files/ misc. 
    >> mkdir bids_conversion 
[6] Create folder for eventual analysis pipelines accord to BIDS format 
    >> mkdir derivatives 
[7] Install docker (following BIDS Walkthrough tutorial) 
    >> sudo snap install docker 
[8] Pull heudiconv using docker 
    >> sudo docker pull nipy/heudiconv:latest
[9] Dry run of heudiconv 
    >> sudo docker run --rm -it -v /home/sharky/Documents/2EProject:/base nipy/heudiconv:latest -d /base/01-SubjectScans/2E_{subject}/dicom_files/SCANS/*/DICOM/*.dcm -o /base/rawdata/ -f convertall -s 006 -c none --overwrite 
    * Various directory paths (dicoms saved at various levels)
        * for controls and some 2E subjects: /base/0*/*{subject}/dicom_files/*/scans/*/resources/DICOM/files/*.dcm 
        * for 2E subjects: /base/0*/*{subject}/dicom_files/*/SCANS/*/DICOM/*.dcm 
        * for 2E_006 only: /base/0*/*{subject}/dicom_files/SCANS/*/DICOM/*.dcm 
[10] Create heuristic file
    * see file in /home/sharky/Documents/2EProject/bids_conversion/heuristic.py
[11] Create bash script to run heuristic file 
    * See file in /home/sharky/Documents/2EProject/bids_conversion/01_run_heuristic.sh
[12] Run subject through conversion using bash script 
    >> bash 01_run_heuristic.sh 
    >> got this issue https://neurostars.org/t/heudiconv-single-session-problems-with-heuristic-py/4910/3 and deleted files according to solution person found 
    >> cd /home/sharky/Documents/2EProject/rawdata 
    >> sudo rm -fr .heudiconv 
    >> reran heuristic with no issues
[13] Check output folder (rawdata) in the BIDS validator: https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/ 
[14] Run remaining subjects through conversion using bash script
