STEP 1. Create masks for T1ws 
	1.1. In ~/Documents/2EProject/derivatives/masks/code use run_bet.sh to run bet on all subjects. See comments in run_bet.sh for instructions on how to use this script. 
	1.2. Use tracking sheet to track if bet was run (when and by who) and what fractional intensity threshold was used to create the mask (0.5 is default in script. To change the threshold see instructions here https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET/UserGuide). 
	1.3. QC the masks using fsleyes. Load the subject's corresponding T1w scan from their folder in ~/Documents/2EProject/rawdata and the mask created in ~/Documents/2EProject/derivatives/masks/bet and overlay the mask onto the T1w. You can change the opacity of the mask to see the underlying brain. If the brain is generally covered by the mask you do not need to rerun bet. If the mask is very underinclusive, it is worth rerunning bet on a single subject trying different fractional intensity thresholds to get better coverage. 

STEP 2. Edit masks with Slicer 
	2.1. Open Slicer: change directory to /home/sharky/Slicer-4.11.20210226-linux-amd64 and open Slicer by typing ./Slicer &
	2.2. Open Editor Module: In the toolbar at the top of the Slicer window, click on the magnifying glass to the right of "Modules" and search "Editor" and select the Editor module.
	2.3 Load Scans into Slicer: Use the "Data" button with a green up arrow on the toolbar to load data. Load the subject's T1w scan from rawdata and their mask from the bet folder using the "Choose File(s) to Add" button. Do this twice, once for each file. Check the "Show Options" box at the top right of the data selection window. Scroll to the right and for your mask file check the "LabelMap" option. Click "OK" at the bottom right to load the files. 
	2.3. Specify scans: On the left side of the Slicer window, specify the T1w scan for the "Master Volume" field, and specify the mask file for the "Merge Volume" field. 
	2.4 Get set-up to edit: At the very top left, click "View" andin the "Layout" dropdown menu select an orientation to view- I normally start with "Red Slice Only". At the red bar above the view of the brain, click on the pushpin icon, click on the two circles overlapping eeach other to link both of your loaded images together (they should now be two closed circles). Select the dropdown with the two arrows to the left of the pushpin ">>" and you can play around with your view. I like to have my mask at 0.5 transparency. 
	2.5 Edit your mask: starting in one view, scroll from one side to the other of your brain and mask, making sure that your mask is covering the brain. You can use tools on the left side of the Slicer window (below "Edit Selected Label Map") to make edits to the mask. 
	2. . Save edited mask in ~/Documents/2EProject/derivatives/masks/edited_masks
